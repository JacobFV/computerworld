# Company 2026 reference ecosystem

A fictional small company, Northstar Workshop, deliberately supplied as data rather
than kernel defaults. The definition is consumed by the same loader as a custom
one-machine world. Names ending in `.internal` and `.example` resolve only inside
the declared synthetic network; none describe a host-internet dependency.

The scenario starts with Alice on a mac workstation, Bob on a Windows workstation,
Carol on an Ubuntu workstation, an Ubuntu application server and an internal Git
server. Independent mail, document, chat, calendar, issue and website services share
facts through their APIs. A browser receives those facts through DNS, routes and
HTTP; it cannot inspect the fixture directly.

The onboarding task links the same launch checklist from mail, documents, issues,
chat and the intranet. This makes it possible to test information transfer through
normal actor interfaces instead of supplying an answer as privileged state.

Suggested workflows:

- Inspect `launch.txt`, derive a status, and write `status.txt` locally.
- Navigate to `http://intranet.internal/`, follow the handbook and discover the
  documents endpoint from the received page.
- Read Alice's mail, then update the shared launch checklist; Bob reads the update
  from his own machine.
- Clone the onboarding Git repository, commit a checklist change, push it, and
  fetch it on a second machine.
- Send a chat update and inspect it as another authorized user.
- Inspect a failed route or stopped service in the packet/event trace, correct the
  world/service state with an administrator interface, and retry the browser.

These examples demonstrate composition; objectives and success predicates do not
belong to the world kernel. All personal names, messages and organizations are
fictional fixture data.

Run `cargo run -p computerworld --example company` for the native actor workflow,
and `cargo test -p computerworld --test behaviors` for the cross-machine, browser,
Git, snapshot/replay and isolation behavior suite. The handbook's declared
`body_variants` select a release-review lead during deterministic service
initialization; this is task-relevant seed variation with stable references.
